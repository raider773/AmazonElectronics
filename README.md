Sentiment analysis with Amazon electronics reviews

This project is a simple prediction on whether a review is positive or negative one. \
In the first notebook i analyse a little bit the reviews. Just the reviews as this is an NPL problem. \ 
I also binarize the problem to two classes, good or bad, instead of 1 to 5 rating as in the original data. \
The data is in json format so i transform it into csv format.


In the second notebook i used Multinomial Naive Bayes models to do the predictions as well as transforming the data as needed. \
Finally i deployed the model to flask and test the model with self-made comments
